## Front end for lifts

> **WARNING**: This repo is extremely scuffed and not even worthy of being called a POC. 

Messing around with learning NextJS + React at the same time. There is no TDD in sight here. 

## Install

`npm i`
`npm run build`
`npm run dev`

## To-do: 

* Add style / make less ugly
* Cache chart JSON code (5 second load times are fun)
* Add other pages 
* Tests 

## Long term to eventually to-do
*  add config file / deploy environment values + setup to support
* Migrate to TypeScript
