I can't make them stick. Writing with a target audience of future me just doesn't seem to work. Future-Jack mercilessly loathes past-Jack and deletes all his private thoughts. </p>\n<p>But I don't know if it would be the same for current-Jack's public thoughts. They've got timestamps attached to them. They're not meant to represent an ever-green conception of myself. </p>\n<p>For quite a while testing this theory has been blocked by the absence of somewhere public to put them. Oh <em>sure</em> I could have used SquareSpace or LiveJournal or other such nonsense, but I'm a Software Engineer, <em>surely</em> I've got to build it myself. </p>\n<p>And so it has been put off. For months and then years.</p>\n<p>Until today. On this Sunday Claude and I have vibe-slopped together a passable minimal website. I don't think it's very good, but at least it is <em>something</em> and it is <em>live</em>. </p>\n<p>See you in the future. Maybe.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>P.S</p>\n<p>Wow writing is hard and wow I am not good at it! </p>\n"
