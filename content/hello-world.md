# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post written in **markdown**.

## What I'm Building

I'm creating a minimal blog using:

- Deno for the backend
- Eta for templating
- @deno/gfm for markdown processing

## Features

Here are some things I can do:

1. Write in markdown
2. Include code blocks:

```typescript
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);
```

3. Add *emphasis* and **strong** text
4. Create [links](https://deno.land)

That's it for now. More posts coming soon!
