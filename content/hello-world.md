Ah, the traditional call of the Software Engineer, exclaiming hello to the world. 

I don't expect the world to say anything back though. Nor should it, there's nothing  of value here.

##  So why does this exist then?

I have long suspected that in order to properly 'think' and process my thoughts that I must write them down. 

I have tried using Obsidian.md and IRL notebooks. I can't make them stick. Writing with a target audience of future me just doesn't seem to work. Future-Jack mercilessly loathes past-Jack and deletes all his private thoughts. 

But I don't know if it would be the same for current-Jack's public thoughts. They've got timestamps attached to them. They're not meant to represent an ever-green conception of myself. 

For quite a while testing this theory has been blocked by the absence of somewhere public to put them. Oh _sure_ I could have used SquareSpace or LiveJournal or other such nonsense, but I'm a Software Engineer, _surely_ I've got to build it myself. 

And so it has been put off. For months and then years.

Until today. On this Sunday Claude and I have vibe-slopped together a passable minimal website. I don't think it's very good, but at least it is *something* and it is *live*. 

See you in the future. Maybe.

P.S

Wow writing is hard and wow I am not good at it!
