## Cool but not for copying 
vanholtz.co (just because its cool)

## Blog la\yout

3 columns. Primmary fat one like Herault's. Side columns (desktop only?) display footnotes / additional thoughts. Auto fornatted / structured?'Hand drawn', curvy lines / loops.  Only show when note clicked on [what about hover?] but should look aestethic if all expanded.

'Marginalia'

## Design principles

Blog = noJS
Lifts - should have noJS option.
